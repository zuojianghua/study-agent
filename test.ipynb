       "AIMessage(content='<think>\\nOkay, the user wants to translate \"I love programming.\" into French. Let me start by recalling the basic structure of the sentence. The subject is \"I,\" which in French is \"Je.\" The verb \"love\" here is \"aimer,\" but since the sentence is in the present tense and the subject is \"Je,\" the conjugation would be \"aime.\" Then \"programming\" translates to \"la programmation.\" So putting it all together, it should be \"Je aime la programmation.\" Wait, but in French, when using the verb \"aimer,\" the preposition \"de\" is often used after the verb. So maybe it\\'s \"Je aime la programmation\" or \"Je aime la programmation.\" Wait, no, actually, \"aimer\" can take a direct object without a preposition. For example, \"Je aime les maths\" (I love math). But sometimes, especially with abstract nouns, you might use \"de\" before the noun. However, in standard French, \"Je aime la programmation\" is correct. Let me check an example. If I search for \"I love programming in French,\" the common translation is \"J\\'aime la programmation.\" Oh, right, the \"Je\"', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'qwen3:8b', 'created_at': '2025-05-24T13:25:20.6113883Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'length', 'total_duration': 7973618400, 'load_duration': 2037024100, 'prompt_eval_count': 30, 'prompt_eval_duration': 138950900, 'eval_count': 256, 'eval_duration': 5797041700, 'model_name': 'qwen3:8b'}, id='run--f2f1f0d9-dce5-4d58-8abc-97060bcb1e7a-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 30, 'output_tokens': 256, 'total_tokens': 286})"
